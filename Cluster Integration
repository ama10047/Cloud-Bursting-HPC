# Description: Final project script to document the steps for deploying and configuring
# an HPC cluster on Google Cloud Platform using Slurm, Apptainer, and MPI

# SECTION 1: Introduction
# This script outlines the procedures used to deploy a High-Performance Computing (HPC)
# cluster on GCP, integrate it with NYU Greene, and set up containerized MPI workloads.

# SECTION 2: Project Objectives

    "Deploy a scalable HPC cluster on GCP using Slurm",
    "Ensure secure file transfer mechanisms between NYU Greene and GCP",
    "Implement a load balancer for traffic management",
    "Set up Apptainer, Singularity, and MPI for containerized computational tasks",
    "Optimize performance by adjusting machine types and CPU configurations"

# SECTION 8: Conclusion
project_conclusion = """
This project successfully demonstrated the deployment of a scalable HPC cluster on GCP
with Slurm job scheduling, containerization using Apptainer, secure data transfers, and
performance optimization. The setup supports diverse research workflows and can be further
enhanced with GPU support and automated pipelines.
